# Guloggratis.dk

The is a small light demo version of guloggratis website.

You can take as long as you want, but we don't expect a full fletched version, it is meant as a starting point for
discusstions.

Focus on the parts you feel most confident about, ignore the rest.

## TODO:

I have sprinkled a lot of little `TODO` anound in the code. These are just suggestions, if you want do add something
else, or just change the code that is allready there, feel free to do that.

> yarn install
```
