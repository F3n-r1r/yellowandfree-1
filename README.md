# Guloggratis.dk

The is a small light demo version of guloggratis website.

You can take as long as you want, but we don't expect a full fletched version, it is meant as a starting point for
discussions.

Focus on the parts you feel most confident about, ignore the rest.

## TODO:

I have sprinkled a lot of little `TODO` around in the code. These are just suggestions, if you want do add something
else, or just change the code that is already there, feel free to do that.

## Gettings started:

```bash
> yarn install
```

Starting api

```bash
> cd api
> yarn dev
```

Starting site

```bash
> cd site
> yarn dev
```

[open site](http://localhost:3000)

- Best of luck, Brian
